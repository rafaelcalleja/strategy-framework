# PHP Wrapper for Quaderno API
This library is a PHP wrapper to connect and handle the [Quaderno API] (https://github.com/recrea/quaderno-api) in a nicer way. It connects to your account in quaderno.io, so you will need to have a valid account to use it.

## Why using it?
You will need this if you want to connect to the Quaderno API from your PHP application with no need to be handling annoying low-level HTTP requests and JSON-encoded data.

## Requirements
* PHP 5
* [cURL] (http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) (included by default in recent PHP versions)

## Installation
Copy all the files into a single folder in your project

## Usage
A rule of thumb to take into account when using the wrapper is that calls to the API are actually only made with the methods: '_find()_', '_save()_', '_delete()_', '_deliver()_' and '_ping()_'.

### Load
```php
require_once 'quaderno_load.php';
```

### Setup
```php
QuadernoBase::init('YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID');
```

### Testing connection
```php
QuadernoBase::ping();                         // Returns true (success) or false (error)
```


### Contacts
#### -- Find contacts
Returns _false_ if request fails.
```php
$contacts = QuadernoContact::find();                    // Returns an array of QuadernoContact
$contacts = QuadernoContact::find(array('page' => 2));  // Returns an array of QuadernoContact
$contact = QuadernoContact::find('IDTOFIND');           // Returns a QuadernoContact
```

#### -- Creating and updating a contact
```php
$contact = new QuadernoContact(array(
                                 'first_name' => 'Joseph',
                                 'last_name' => 'Tribbiani',
                                 'email' => 'joseph@friends.com',
                                 'contact_name' => 'Joey'));

$contact->save();                             // Returns true (success) or false (error)

$contact->first_name = "";
$contact->save();                             // Returns false - first_name is a required field
foreach($contact->errors as $field => $errors) { 
  print "{$field}: ";
  foreach ($errors as $e) print $e;
}

$contact->first_name = 'Joey';
$contact->save();
```


### Documents
A document is either an _invoice_, an _expense_ or an _estimate_.

#### -- Find documents
```php
$invoices = QuadernoInvoice::find();                      // Returns an array of QuadernoInvoice
$invoices = QuadernoInvoice::find(array('page' => 2));    // Returns an array of QuadernoInvoice
$invoice = QuadernoInvoice::find("IDTOFIND");             // Returns a QuadernoInvoice
```

#### -- Create and update a document
```php
$estimate = new QuadernoEstimate(array(
                                 'subject' => 'Business website',
                                 'notes' => 'With mobile version',
                                 'currency' => 'EUR'));

$estimate->save();                            // Returns true (success) or false (error)

$estimate->notes = 'Finally, no mobile version will be necessary';
$estimate->save();
```

#### -- Deliver a document
Only possible in invoices and estimates. The contact must have an email address defined.
```php
$invoice->deliver();                          // Return true (success) or false (error)

```


### Payments
#### -- Add a payment to a document
Only possible in invoices and expenses. Input should be a QuadernoPayment object.
```php
$payment = new QuadernoPayment(array(                                         
                                 'date' => date('2012-10-10'),
                                 'payment_method' => 'credit_card'));

$invoice->addPayment($payment);               // Return true (success) or false (error)
$invoice->save();                             // Returns true (success) or false (error)
```

#### -- Get payments of a document
```php
$payments = $expense->getPayments();          // Returns an array of QuadernoPayment
```

#### -- Remove a payment from a document
```php
$expense->removePayment($payments[2]);         // Return true (success) or false (error)
```
